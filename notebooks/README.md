### FYP2_YOLO_MangroveDetection.ipynb
Demonstrates YOLO training and experiments on the mangrove dataset. YOLOv8 was selected as the baseline architecture of HTD Model.

### HTD.ipynb
Implements the HTD Model, which builds on YOLOv8's object detection capabilities.
A domain-specific computer vision filter (HSV) is applied to verify detected tree trunks within each bounding box and perform counting.
